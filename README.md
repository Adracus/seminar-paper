You will need a LaTeX Distribution like TeX Live. Then you can simply compile
the document with

	pdflatex seminarpaper.tex

> Hint: You might need to compile a couple of times so the table of contents is
> correctly built

To cleanup all documents except the actual `.tex` files and pictures (like all
files generated by compiling) run

	git clean -Xf
