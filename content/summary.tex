\section{Primes with Miller Rabin}

In the current implementation of Duse, Mersenne primes are used to
compute in finite fields. They are easy to compute and there are
plenty of numbers lower than the used ones. An issue which results
of the Mersenne Primes is the predictability of the prime number
which is used for encryption. Also, encryption is limited to secrets
which are smaller than the largest prime number. If one wants to
get a larger prime number than the largest mersenne prime number the
computation time rises drastically. This is because all numbers
$< \sqrt{n}$ (where $n$ is an uneven number being tested) have to be evaluated
as possible dividers of $n$. If $n$ is not a prime, $n+1$ has to be
tested until a prime number is found. The computation time can be
decreased by applying a special version of the Sieve of Erathostenes but
it is still way too high. This is where the \textit{Miller-Rabin Test}
comes in. The Miller-Rabin Test is a Monte-Carlo algorithm. If one inputs
a number $n$, the tests has two possible results: It either returns
that $n$ is not a prime number or that $n$ is propably a prime number.
Internally, the test consist of congruency characteristics of prime numbers.
The test can be repeated and the propability of a number not being a
prime being accepted as prime is $\frac{1}{4^s}$, where s is the number
of iterations of the Miller-Rabin Test.

Although it is not as secure as exact computation, the Miller-Rabin Test
is also used in the RSA internals to get high prime numbers for the
private- and public key generation. RSA is considered as a secure
encryption scheme (also with secure paddings etc.) and if such a tested
software can rely on prime numbers generated by using the miller rabin
algorithm, Duse can too.

\section{RSA OAEP}

The PKCS#1v1.5 padding scheme is not considered secure since
\textit{Bleichenbacher's CRYPTO 98 Paper} \cite{rsabulletin}
revealed a chosen ciphertext
attack. It is still used inside TLS encryption at the time of writing,
but just because TLS does it doesn't make it right. A very important
future work is to replace the default PKCS#1v1.5 padding scheme with
the more secure OAEP padding scheme.

OAEP is an algorithm which is a form of a \textit{Feistel Network}\footnote{
  Feistel Networks or Feistel Ciphers are symmetric structures which are used
  during the construction of block ciphers with the most prominent example
  being the DES encryption. In general, a Feistel cipher is a cipher which
  iteratively applies an internal function, often referred as \textit{round function}.
}. OAEP prevents information leakage caused by partial decryption of 
ciphertexts and also turns deterministic encryption schemes like RSA into
propabilistic encryption schemes. When used with RSA, OAEP is called
RSA-OAEP.
