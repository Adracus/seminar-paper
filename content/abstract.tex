\chapter*{Abstract}

In todays digital world every person has countless credentials for services
they use. Not only must these credentials be complex enough to withstand
possible attacks, but they have to be kept secret. This becomes particularly
hard once these secrets must be shared with other people or organizations. The
big problem is that to be able to recognize these secrets they must be simple
enough for a human to memorize, and when the secret is shared then everyone
involved must also be informed once it has changed.

This paper illustrates, how secure secret sharing over the internet can be done
using known cryptographic algorithms. Not only can those secrets always be in
sync, but they can also be complex enough to contain an attack since no human
has to remember them. This also allows sharing secrets of infinite size.

The mechanism has been implemented, using the theory from this paper, and is
now known as \textit{duse} (DistribUted SEcrets).
