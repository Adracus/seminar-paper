Cryptography Fundamentals
=========================

A Cryptographic Protocol
------------------------

A cryptographic protocol is a combination of cryptographic primitives,
algorithms and possibly other cryptographic protocols. The protocol describes
how the cryptographic algorithms are used in order to increase confidentiality,
integrity and availablility of the underlying goal.

Cryptographic protocols are usually defined abstract in order to leave language
specific dificulties up to the implementation. Since only the interfaces are
defined, the developers can implement against those and therefore make sure
different implementations are compatible to each other.

Cryptographic primitives
------------------------

The most basic building blocks in the field of cryptography are known as
cryptographic primitives. They include well researched, reliable and accepted
algorithms. Digital signatures, one-way has functions, as and public key
cryptography are examples for cryptographic primitives.
